**Java Project**

Second year project presenting a vehicle agency management system which is operated by a GUI system and interfaces together with the various departments.

The system will open a Swing window to the user where he can choose between several actions that exist in the vehicle agency such as adding a vehicle to the agency, buying a vehicle, taking a vehicle for a test drive, displaying an inventory report that showing the user the details of all the vehicles in the agency, changing the flag for marine vehicles, etc...
Each time a vehicle is added to the agency, the system will add a picture that matches the type of vehicle the user has chosen and display the details of the added vehicle.

The system makes use of the design patterns Delegator, Singleton, Observer and Memento to enable maximum space and time efficiency of the program. In addition, treadmills are also used using the Thread Pool design template so that, for example, when a customer wants to take a car for a test drive, the treadmill will go to "sleep" for a few seconds depending on the amount of kilometers of the test drive.
